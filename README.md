# Planner-For-All

A website which allows a user to create a day planner!

## Description

This is a planner website which allows the user to create their own planner (for business hours) and has been dynamically created through JavaScript for functionality.This assignment was given to me with the created HTML and CSS, however I had to add all the code in the JavaScript to add functionality and udpated the website dynamically. By creating the HTML and CSS, the website has been styled and content has been added on there. This planner shows the current date and is color coded based on past, present, and future events. (Past is in grey, present is in red and future is in green). This website also utilizes local storage to save user's input.

## Usage

When the user first enters the website, it loads with the current date in this format: Day of the week, Month, and number of date as well as the year. Then, the user can see that the time (hour) which has already passed is in that block and is colored grey. The user can also see that the block that is the current hour is in red. Lastly, the user is able to see that the color block for future is in green. The user can also type anything in the text area and click the blue button on the right and it will save it to local storage. 

As the user can see in the screenshots below, the date is shown on the page (this will automatically update on whichever date the user is in the planner). The user can see that right now it is 2PM since that text block is color-coded red and can also see that from 9AM-1PM it is grey since that time has already passed. The user can also see that the future (upcoming times from 3PM-5PM) is in grey.
