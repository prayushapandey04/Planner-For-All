# Planner-For-All

A website which allows a user to create a day planner!

## Description

This is a planner website which creates a planner for the user based on if the time has passed already or not! This assignment was given to me with the created HTML and CSS, however I had to add all the code in the JavaScript to add functionality and udpated the website dynamically. By creating the HTML and CSS, the website has been styled and content has been added on there. This planner shows the current date and is color coded based on past, present, and future events. (Past is in grey, present is in red and future is in green). This website also utilizes local storage to save user's input.

## Usage

When the user first enters the website, it loads with the current date in this format: Day of the week, Month, and number of date as well as the year. Then, the user can see that the time (hour) which has already passed is in that block and is colored grey. The user can also see that the block that is the current hour is in red. Lastly, the user is able to see that the color block for future is in green. The user can also type anything in the text area and click the blue button on the right and it will save it to local storage.
